# Solar System ðŸ’›

Overview:
I love space and wanted to create my own solar system for a long time.<br>
As for the code: it follows a simple pattern: transform object, and make it rotate on its inner circle.<br>
Also, I adjusted planets so they look with their bright side to the sun using degree transform to please visually.<br>
Way more work I invested in the correct visualization of space objects.<br>
All the mapped objects: moons, asteroid rings, planets, and its orbits correspond to reality.<br>
There are many objects missing, of course, all dwarf the planets beside Pluto,<br>
moons of Saturn, comments, and other objects.<br>
Unfortunately, there are no rings of Neptune as nobody pictures it with rings since they are slightly visible.<br>
The animated Sun and outer space were added to add feel of animation and immersion.<br>

Use scroller, trackpad, and CTRL+- (Windows) or CMND+- (MAC) to zoom in and out to scale the planets for their study!<br>
Noticed the <input type="range"> in the upper left corner? Great! With it you can control time of the universe!<br>

Thanks to NASA for their attention to detail.<br>
You collect with love the fragmented images of cosmic objects and give them bright colors and volume.
